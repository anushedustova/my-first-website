# my-first-website
the beginning of my programming adventure-->les gooooo 02.2022&lt;--

Here you find all elements of my first website.
There is a structure in index.html, layout and appearance in styles.css, menu's functionality in script.js 
There is also a document named normalize.CSS added to systematize the page regardless of the browser, as well as fontawesome-all.css (in the styles folder) and the webfonts folder, thanks to which I have icons in the interests section of the webpage.
