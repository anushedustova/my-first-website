# my-first-website
the beginning of my programming adventure-->les gooooo 02.2022&lt;--
Here you find all elements of my first website: index.html is the structure, layout and appearance in styles.cssscript.js contains the interactive part, whereas the rest is responsible for the appearance, namely fonts and images.
There is a structure in index.HTML, layout and appearance in styles.css, the functionality of a  menu in a script.js 
There is also a document named normalize.CSS added to systematize the page regardless of the browser, as well as fontawesome-all.css (in the styles folder) and the webfonts folder, thanks to which I have icons in the interests section of the webpage.
